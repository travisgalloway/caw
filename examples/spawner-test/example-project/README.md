# Example Project

A minimal TypeScript project used as a target workspace for testing the `@caw/spawner` package.

## Structure

- `src/index.ts` — Main entry point
- `src/utils.ts` — Utility functions (agents will modify this)

## Purpose

This project gives spawned agents something concrete to work on. Test tasks include:
- Adding new functions to `utils.ts`
- Creating test files
- Modifying existing code
